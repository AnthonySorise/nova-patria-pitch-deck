Spearheaded by Anthony Sorise, the project has been a balance of part-time and full-time dedication. Approximately half of the development period involved a part-time commitment of 10 to 15 hours per week, while the remaining duration saw a full-time commitment of 40 to 50 hours per week. Presently, the project is more than halfway through the Alpha stage, and steadily progressing towards the final product.'}
